By Professor Russel Pears.

The deployment is done in EC2 instance, and usually it is in stopped state, to run the instance please contact rajeshnemani@my.unt.edu

The templates folder should be unzipped before using as while uploading templates folder without compressing results in loss of data.

Unable to upload the csv file as even the compressed dataset file is not accepted by the github to upload.So Please download the dataset from the kaggle link mentioned in project proposal.
